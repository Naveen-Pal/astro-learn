# NDA SSB Airforce in Gandhinagar

It wasn't always smooth sailing, but I'm enjoying building with Astro. And, the [Discord community](https://astro.build/chat) is really friendly and helpful!

I qualify the NDA Written in year 2022 and 2023. I could not go for the SSB first time due to my JEE mains January attempt. There was only three days gap between my NDA SSB and jee mains. I don't want to spoil JEE but I want to go for the NDA SSB(I goal was not to become any airfore officer I just want to gain 5 day experience in NDA Airforce SSB). 

My preferences was airforce, navy and army.
